# Model-Monitoring
DS440 Group 6

Model monitoring is the practice of measuring model performance. As a field, model monitoring is broadly defined. A model monitoring system can monitor features including but not limited to predictive correctness, hardware usage, the integrity of input data, and data drifts. Monitoring these features allows model users to spot model malfunctions as early as possible and prevent loss

Our team will craft a model monitoring system that can inform users of key metrics related to their trained model and input data. It is assumed that users will perform necessary measures specific to their scenarios to provide a satisfactory baseline model before monitoring. From this, we hope to learn the viability of model monitoring in everyday machine learning tasks, and will apply this knowledge to compare our monitoring system against existing open source systems.
